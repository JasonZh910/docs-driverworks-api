## DownloadFile

Function that causes a file to be downloaded from a URL to a specified location on the file system.

###### Available from 3.3.1


### Signature

`C4:DownloadFile(url, filename, subdir, table)`


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| url | String of the URL to the download file. |
| filename | The file name (without path) where the file will downloaded.|
| subdir | A directory alias, such as "SANDBOX", "MEDIA", "C4Z", etc. that the file should be downloaded to. |
| table | A table of request headers and values to be sent. |


### Returns

_Nothing_

### Usage Note
The C4:DownloadFile() function will make an HTTP GET request to the specified server, and stream the data that is returned to the specified location on the file system.   The events that are usually triggered by the C4:url():Get() call are not triggered with the exception of the OnDone() event.   When the transfer is complete, the OnDone() event will be triggered and passed the headers from the transfer, but not the actual data that was written to the file system.

### Example

```lua
myurl = C4:url()
myurl:OnDone(function(transfer, responses, errCode, errMsg)
   if (errCode == 0) then
    local lresp = responses[#responses]
    print("OnDone: transfer succeeded (" .. #responses .. " responses received), last response code: " .. lresp.code)
    for hdr,val in pairs(lresp.headers) do
     print("OnDone: " .. hdr .. " = " .. val)
    end
    print("OnDone: body of last response: " ..tostring(lresp.body))
   else
    if (errCode == -1) then
     print("OnDone: transfer was aborted")
    else
     print("OnDone: transfer failed with error " .. errCode .. ": " .. errMsg .. " (" .. #responses .. " responses completed)")
    end
   end
  end)
myurl:DownloadFile("https://www.google.com", "test.txt")
print("scheduled url transfer with id " .. myurl:TicketId())
```
