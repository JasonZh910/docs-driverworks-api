### Usage Note

Note that there is a race condition inherent in the use of this function. The network port may, or may not be in use at the moment that the function is invoked. However, it is possible for the network port to be freed or utilized by another process during the time that the function is invoked and a driver attempts to make use of the network port.

### Example

```lua
     function OnDriverLateInit()
       -- Our driver requires port 8888.  If not available, print error
       if (C4:PortInUse(8888)) then
         print("ERROR: Required Port 8888 is already in use by some other driver or process.")
       end
     end
```
