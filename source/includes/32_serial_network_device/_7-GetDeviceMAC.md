## GetDeviceMAC

Returns the MAC Address associated with a device that has already been identified in the Control4 Project. The API uses address resolution protocol (ARP) queries to lookup MAC hardware addresses. It will return a value of nil if the MAC address is not found in the controller's ARP tables. Considerations when using GetDeviceMAC include:

1. If a device responds to a search protocol (SSDP/SDDP/DDDP), a high probability exists that there will be an entry for the device in the ARP tables.
2. If a device doesn't respond to a search protocol, establishing a connection to the device is usually sufficient to ensure that there's an entry in the ARP tables.
3. If a device goes to sleep or is otherwise offline for any reason, then there is a low probability that there will be an entry in the ARP tables.
