## OnSystemEvent

Your driver will need to implement the “OnSystemEvent” method. See the example to the right:


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| data | The “data” passed to this callback function is event specific and can be provided on an event by event basis as needed.  In most cases, it can be ignored. |


### Example

```lua
function OnSystemEvent(data)
   print("System Event occurred - data: " .. data)
end
```
