## Overview

Webservice Authentication using Lua

Control4 drivers have the ability to perform Basic and Digest authentication with a web service using any of the `url*Â `APIs within this Interface. Authentication is achieved by passing the username and password within the string parameter used by each of the APIs. 

Note: Starting with O.S 3, sample drivers are being delivered with the DriverWorks SDK. Included in the sample driver delivery is the generic-http driver which demonstrates how to do basic C4:url calls. The sample driver can be found at the root level of the SDK or DriverWorks SDK/Samples.

Also included in the Samples directory is an example websockets client driver.
