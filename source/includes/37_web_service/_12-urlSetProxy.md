## Usage Note

Control4 Web Service APIs, specifically those beginning with [C4:url][1], send the following default Headers with the HTTP(s) request:

```html
Host: <DNS name or IP of server>,
Accept: "/",
Accept-Encoding: "deflate, gzip"
Connection: "close", is suggested and
```

It is recommend that these Headers NOT be overwritten. Note that a user-agent string is not included in the default Headers. However, including one within a driver is suggested as it makes diagnostics easier for servers.


### Examples

`C4:urlSetProxy("www.mywebsite.com", 8080, "me", "mypassword")`
