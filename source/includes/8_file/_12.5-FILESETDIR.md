## FileSetDir
In conjunction with O.S. release 3.3.0, this function is being restricted to allowed locations whereas previously it had full root access. As part of Control4â€™s plan to tighten driver security, the io.popen() call has been removed. In doing this, driver developers need to use C4:File commands to accomplish what they previously did with io.popen (). Prior to O.S. release 3.3.0, C4:FileSetDir had root access which would allow driver developers to modify anything on the file system. 


### Signature

`C4:FileSetDir()`


### Examples

C4:FileSetDir(full\_path) - Provided for backwards compatibility using allowed paths only.

C4:FileSetDir(PATH\_ALIAS) - Specifying alias only.

C4:FileSetDir(PATH\_ALIAS, sub\_dir) - Specifying alias with a subdirectory of PATH\_ALIAS

PATH\_ALIAS: The path aliases are defined in the table below. When specifying a PATH\_ALIAS, the alias will be replaced by the "Path" as described in the table.

| Path Alias | Path |
| --- | --- |
| SANDBOX | /lua/sandbox/15  (location for driver with device id 15) |
| LOGGING | /var/log/debug |
| MEDIA | /media |
| C4Z |  /opt/control4/var/drivers/c4z/\<driver\_name\>  |
