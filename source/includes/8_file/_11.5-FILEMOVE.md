## FileMove
Function for or moving files within certain restrictions.  As part of Control4â€™s plan to tighten driver security, the io.popen() call has been removed. In doing this, driver developers need to use C4:File commands to accomplish what they previously did with io.popen () This API provides the ability to move files as previously done with io.popen. 
 

_This API was introduced in O.S. Release 3.3.0_


### Signature

`C4:FileMove()`


| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| string | PATH\_ALIAS\_FROM: is a path representation/alias to an allowed location as to where a file may be moved from. |
| string | PATH\_ALIAS\_TO: A path representation/alias to an allowed location as to where it will be moved to. The following table is a list of allowed aliases. |
| string | From: A path relative to PATH\_ALIAS\_FROM  and the file name to be moved. |
| string | To: A path relative to PATH\_ALIAS\_TO and the file name for the destination of the file. If the file name is the same then the file name does not need to be included. |


| Path Alias | Path |
| --- | --- |
| SANDBOX | /lua/sandbox/15  (location for driver with device id 15) |
| LOGGING | /var/log/debug |
| MEDIA | /media |
| C4Z |  /opt/control4/var/drivers/c4z/\<driver\_name\>  |

Note that path aliases are required and cannot be replaced with the actual path. 


### Example

Assuming that the device id of the driver is 15, the following command will move /lua/sandbox/15/tmp/tmpFile.dat to /lua/sandbox/15/data/dataFile.dat

C4:FileMove("SANDBOX", "/tmp/tmpFile.dat", "SANDBOX", "/data/dataFile.dat")
