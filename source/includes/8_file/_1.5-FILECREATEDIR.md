## FileCreateDir
Function to create a new directory. As part of Control4â€™s plan to tighten driver security, the io.popen() call has bee removed. In doing this, driver developers need to use C4:File commands to accomplish what they previously did with io.popen (). This API provides the ability to create anew directory as previously done with io.popen. 
 

_This API was introduced in O.S. Release 3.3.0_


### Signature

`C4:FileCreateDir()`


| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| string | PATH\_ALIAS: Path alias to an allowed location where a directory may be created. |
| string | DirCreate: A path relative to PATH\_ALIAS and the directory name for the directory to create. |


| Path Alias | Path |
| --- | --- |
| SANDBOX | /lua/sandbox/15  (location for driver with device id 15) |
| LOGGING | /var/log/debug |
| MEDIA | /media |
| C4Z |  /opt/control4/var/drivers/c4z/\<driver\_name\>  |

Note that path aliases are required and cannot be replaced with the actual path. 


### Example

Assuming that the device id of the driver is 15, the following command will create directory "data" in /lua/sandbox/15/.

`C4:FileCreateDir("SANDBOX", "data")`


Assuming the device id of the driver is 15, the following command will create directory "backup" in /lua/sandbox/15/data/.

`C4:FileCreateDir("SANDBOX", "data/backup")`
