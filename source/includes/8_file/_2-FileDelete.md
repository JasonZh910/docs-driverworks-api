## FileDelete
This function has been modified in conjuction with O.S. release 3.3.0.  As part of Control4â€™s plan to tighten driver security, the io.popen() call has been removed. In doing this, driver developers need to use C4:File commands to accomplish what they previously did with io.popen (). Two new parameters have been added to specify an allowed Alias and a sub path and file name to a file to delete. 


### Signature

`C4:FileDelete()`


| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| string| filename |
| string | PATH\_ALIAS: Path representation/alias to an allowed location as to where a file may deleted. |
| string | SubPath: A path relative to PATH\_ALIAS and the file name for the file to delete. |


| Path Alias | Path |
| --- | --- |
| SANDBOX | /lua/sandbox/15  (location for driver with device id 15) |
| LOGGING | /var/log/debug |
| MEDIA | /media |
| C4Z |  /opt/control4/var/drivers/c4z/\<driver\_name\>  |

Note that path aliases are required and cannot be replaced with the actual path. 


### Example

Assuming that the device id of the driver is 15, the following command will delete /lua/sandbox/15/data/datafile.dat. 

`C4:FileDelete(SANDBOX, "data/datafile.dat")`



### Example

`C4:FileDelete("1.txt")`
